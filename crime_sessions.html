<blockquote>
<p>Gun violence is an important problem across the United States. Due to limited data, it has been difficult to convincingly test the impacts of government policies on the quantity and geography of gunfire. This paper uses a new source of data on gunfire incidents, which does not suffer from selective underreporting common in other crime datasets, to measure the effects of juvenile curfews in Washington, DC. Juvenile curfews are a common, but extremely controversial, policy used in cities across the United States. Their goal is to reduce violent crime by keeping would-be offenders and victims indoors, but their net effect on public safety is ambiguous for several reasons. They might also increase distrust between law enforcement and city residents, so it is important to understand whether they are cost-effective. We use exogenous variation in the hours affected by the DC curfew, in regression discontinuity and difference-in-RD frameworks, to estimate the policy’s causal impact on gun violence. We find that, contrary to its goal of improving public safety, DC’s juvenile curfew increases the number of gunfire incidents by 69% during marginal hours.</p>

<h4 id="theeffectofhousingvouchersoncrime:evidencefromalottery">The Effect of Housing Vouchers on Crime: Evidence from a Lottery</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8) is the largest federal housing assistance program; it provides in-kind transfers in the form of rent vouchers to low-income populations. This paper examines the effect of housing voucher receipt on criminal activity. To overcome bias due to selection into the program, we exploit the exogenous variation in lottery-assigned wait-list positions in order to identify the causal effects of the vouchers. Using police department arrest records, we find that voucher receipt increases violent crime, and that this increase is driven by men. We find no effects on arrests for drug or financially motivated crimes.</p>

<h4 id="thecriminalandlabormarketimpactsofincarceration">The Criminal and Labor Market Impacts of Incarceration</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>This paper investigates the pre- and post-release impacts of incarceration on criminal behavior, economic wellbeing and family formation using new data from Harris County, Texas. The research design identifies exogenous variation in the extensive and intensive margins of incarceration by leveraging the random assignment of defendants to courtrooms. I develop a new data-driven estimation procedure to address multidimensional and non-monotonic sentencing patterns observed in the courtrooms in my data. My findings indicate that incarceration generates modest incapacitation effects, which are offset in the long-run by an increased likelihood of defendants reoffending after being released. Additional evidence finds that incarceration reduces post-release employment and wages, increases take-up of food stamps, decreases likelihood of marriage and increases the likelihood of divorce. Based on changes in defendant behavior alone, I estimate that a one-year prison term for marginal defendants conservatively generates $56,200 to $66,800 in social costs, which would require substantial general deterrence in the population to at least be welfare neutral.</p>

<h4 id="wasjanejacobsrighturbanformandcitycrimelevels">Was Jane Jacobs Right? Urban Form and City Crime Levels</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>This paper examines the impact of land use patterns on overall city crime levels. There is considerable evidence that urban form affects the spatial distribution of street crime in cities. However, whether different land use types simply attract crime or generate crime remains unclear. I explore this relationship using detailed microdata on crime and land use. To overcome the endogeneity of land use, I employ an instrumental variables strategy based on historic zoning laws. Consistent with theories from the criminology literature, I find that a larger quantity and greater diffusion of commercial uses leads to higher overall crime levels. However, this effect is mitigated by higher residential density, consistent with the widely-adopted theories of Jane Jacobs. These results have important implications for zoning policy and the optimal design of cities.</p>

<h4 id="testingraceandethnicityinteractionsinthecourtroom">Testing Race and Ethnicity Interactions in the Courtroom</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The racial gap in criminal justice outcomes, from arrest to arraignment to conviction and sentencing, is a well-documented and distressing problem in the United States. This proposal considers a quasi-randomized study of the interaction of client and defense counsel race and quality of counsel on criminal justice case outcomes. Whether or not minority defendants are better served by lawyers of a particular background is of central importance in the fair administration of justice. We will study these interactions in racially diverse Bexar County, TX (home of San Antonio). We take advantage of a comprehensive database from Bexar County, which includes information on all felony and misdemeanor cases filed in District Courts from 1976&#8211;2013. This rich administrative data set will allow us to explore several methods of identifying the role that attorney/client &#8220;matches&#8221; play in criminal justice outcomes. In our main analysis, we exploit the fact that indigent defendants are randomly assigned to assigned counsel defense attorneys to better identify the impacts of race-match on case outcomes. Our data allow us to additionally consider interactions between the race of the prosecutor, defense counsel, and client. The outcomes of interest will span potential contact with the Courts including dismissal, plea-bargaining, guilty finding, and sentencing. In addition, we can better understand the efficacy of assigned counsel for indigent defendants. Here we take advantage of the fact that in our data we can study attorneys who serve as both retained and assigned counsel, helping to avoid the adverse selection problem that plagues much of the literature on this question. Identifying situations in which assigned counsel tends to perform better, or worse, has direct policy implications for reducing disparities in criminal justice outcomes for minority defendants.</p>

<h4 id="mayoralelectionsinfluenceonpoliceandcrime">Mayoral Elections Influence on Police and Crime</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>This paper uses new mayoral election data to analyze implications of election cycles on changes in the size of the police force. Using the new measure for mayoral election, results provide a stronger first-stage estimate for mayoral elections influence on the size of the police force. According to estimates, election years are associated with a 2 percent increase in the number police officers available. Cities with the population larger than 250,000 residents have an average increase in the size of the police force of 2.3 percent during election years. Two-stage least squares estimate indicate a negative relationship between police and crime using election years as instruments. The elasticity of police on violent crime is &#8211;0.74 and as large as &#8211;1.88 for cities with the population greater than 150,000 residents. These results indicate that previous results using electoral cycles as instruments may have been driven by sample restrictions.</p>
